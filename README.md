This is my first website made using only HTML and CSS.  Goal was to design a website for a small business.  In this case it is designing a website for an author.  The author is not very active in Twitter or LinkedIn but replies to post directed to him.  The main goal is to have a site where people can be directed to the Amazon site to purchase the book.
